          The various visual arts exist within a continuum that ranges from
          purely aesthetic purposes at one end to purely utilitarian purposes at
          the other. Such a polarity of purpose is reflected in the commonly
          used terms artist and artisan, the latter understood as one who gives
          considerable attention to the utilitarian. This should by no means be
          taken as a rigid scheme, however. Even within one form of art, motives
          may vary widely; thus a potter or a weaver may create a highly
          functional work that is at the same time beautiful—a salad bowl, for
          example, or a blanket—or may create works that have no purpose beyond
          being admired. In cultures such as those of Africa and Oceania, a
          definition of art that encompasses this continuum has existed for
          centuries. In the West, however, by the mid-18th century the
          development of academies for painting and sculpture established a
          sense that these media were “art” and therefore separate from more
          utilitarian media. This separation of art forms continued among art
          institutions until the late 20th century, when such rigid distinctions
          began to be questioned. Particularly in the 20th century, a different
          sort of debate arose over the definition of art. A seminal moment in
          this discussion occurred in 1917, when Dada artist Marcel Duchamp
          submitted a porcelain urinal entitled Fountain to a public exhibition
          in New York City. Through this act, Duchamp put forth a new definition
          of what constitutes a work of art: he implied that it is enough for an
          artist to deem something “art” and put it in a publicly accepted
          venue. Implicit within this gesture was a challenge to the established
          art institutions—such as museums, exhibiting groups, and
          galleries—that have the power to determine what is and is not
          considered art. Such intellectual experimentation continued throughout
          the 20th century in movements such as conceptual art and minimalism.
          By the turn of the 21st century, a variety of new media (e.g., video
          art) further challenged traditional definitions of art.[P4][AM4][MOD4]
          Art is treated in a number of articles. For general discussions of the
          foundations, principles, practice, and character of art, see
          aesthetics. See also art conservation and restoration.[P5][AM5][MOD5]
          For the technical and theoretical aspects of traditional categories of
          art, see drawing; painting; printmaking; sculpture. For technical and
          historical discussions of decorative arts and furnishings, see
          basketry; enamelwork; floral decoration; furniture; glassware;
          interior design; lacquerwork; metalwork; mosaic; pottery; rug and
          carpet; stained glass; tapestry. See photography for a complete
          history of that medium.
